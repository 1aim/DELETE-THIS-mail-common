pub use soft_ascii_string::{ SoftAsciiStr as _SoftAsciiStr };


/// Defines a new header types with given type name, filed name and component
/// Note that the name is not checked/validated, it has to be ascii, a valid
/// header field name AND has to comply with the naming schema (each word
/// seperated by `'-'` starts with a capital letter and no cappital letter
/// follow, e.g. "Message-Id" is ok but "Message-ID" isn't).
///
/// This macro will create a test which will check if the used field names
/// are actually valid and appears only once (_per def_header macro call_)
/// so as long as test's are run any invalid name will be found.
///
/// Note that even if a invalid name was used and test where ignored/not run
/// this will _not_ cause an rust safety issue, but can still cause bugs under
/// some circumstances (e.g. if you have multiple differing definitions of the
/// same header with different spelling (at last one failed the test) like e.g.
/// when you override default implementations of fields).
///
/// The macros expects following items:
///
/// 1. `test_name`, which is the name the auto-generated test will have
/// 2. `scope`, the scope all components are used with, this helps with some
///    name collisions. Use `self` to use the current scope.
/// 3. a list of header definitions consisting of:
///
///    1. `<typename>` the name the type of the header will have, i.e. the name of a zero-sized
///       struct which will be generated
///    2. `<qunatity>`, stating weather the header can appear at most one time (`maxOne`)
///       or any number of times (`anyNumber`). Note: that only `Date` and `From` are
///       required headers, no other can be made into such.
///    3. `unchecked` a hint to make people read the documentation and not forget the the
///       folowing data is `unchecked` / only vaidated in the auto-generated test
///    4. `"<header_name>"` the header name in a syntax using `'-'` to serperate words,
///       also each word has to start with a capital letter and be followed by lowercase
///       letters additionaly to being a valid header field name. E.g. "Message-Id" is
///       ok, but "Message-ID" is not. (Note that header field name are on itself ignore
///       case, but by enforcing a specific case in the encoder equality checks can be
///       done on byte level, which is especially usefull for e.g. placing them as keys
///       into a HashMap or for performance reasons.
///    5. `<component>` the name of the type to use ing `scope` a the component type of
///       the header. E.g. `Unstructured` for an unstructured header field (which still
///       support Utf8 through encoded words)
///    6. `None`/`<ident>`, None or the name of a validator function (if there is one).
///       This function is called before encoding with the header map as argument, and
///       can cause a error. Use this to enfore contextual limitations like having a
///       `From` with multiple mailboxes makes `Sender` an required field.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```norun
/// def_headers! {
///     // the name of the auto-generated test
///     test_name: validate_header_names,
///     // the scope from which all components should be imported
///     // E.g. `DateTime` refers to `components::DateTime`.
///     scope: components,
///     // definitions of the headers or the form
///     // <type_name>, <quantitiy>, unchecked { <struct_name> }, <component>, <contextual_validator>
///     Date,     maxOne,    unchecked { "Date"          },  DateTime,       None,
///     From,     maxOne,    unchecked { "From"          },  MailboxList,    validator_from,
///     Subject,  maxOne,    unchecked { "Subject"       },  Unstructured,   None,
///     Comments, anyNumber, unchecked { "Comments"      },  Unstructured,   None,
/// }
